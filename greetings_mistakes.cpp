// Code to output the phrase "Greetings Earth" with three mistakes 

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 

int ()
// You need "main" after "int" and before "()".
{

	cout << "Greetings Earth" <<endl;
	cout << "We are much more advanced than you" <<endl;
	count << "We already know c++" <<endl;
// Mispelling "cout" will cause the output not to show.

return ;
// You have to place a value after return, O, in order to know that program ran successfully.
